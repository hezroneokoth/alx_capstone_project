‘Chapa Kazi’ is a Kiswahili phrase which loosely translates to ‘do the work’

ChapaKazi embodies that African spirit and allows you to focus on your tasks while letting us track your progress and remind you of them based on their priorities.

Ours is a task manager application that truly aims to revolutionize task management, provide a powerful tool for individuals (and teams) to stay organized, focused, and on track towards achieving their goals.

I believe managing deadlines requires good time management skills and the ability to prioritize and compartmentalize.

My inspiration for choosing this project is the need to better manage projects and assignments given this current world that quite literally never stops moving.

    2. Allow users to prioritize and organize

    3. To provide visibility with clear view of all tasks including the progress
